There will always be someones who are smarter or better equipped or more creative or more charismatic or better spoken or more generous
or better at small talk or faster or more knowledgeable or more open or more eloquent or better coders or better at math or more
consistently kind or more hard working or more considerate or more humble or more observant than you.</br></br>
If not being as good as you perceive someone else to be makes you feel upset or frustrated or less of a person, reassess and realign
yourself with your goal. Is your goal to be as good as other people? Or is your goal to learn and grow and be as good as you can be?</br>
</br>Is it even possible to ever be as good as someone else? Maybe we can be equal in terms of skill in one very specific area,
but as individuals, we are all so much more than one specific area. We can't ever truly be equal, and that's actually something to value.
Someone being better than you, means that there is someone you can learn from.

He accidentally used a permanent marker. They were able to erase it, but it's definitely something we'll all have to remember and 
really embrace while we're here.

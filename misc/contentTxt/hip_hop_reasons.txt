1. As a dancer, I've always leaned more towards the more fluid types of dance-ballet, lyrical, contemporary-because they all fit well with
my personality. Laid back, go with the flow, not super aggressive, etc. And that's all fine and dandy, and I will always love the
fluidity and gracefulness those genres allow, but I guess the theme of this era in my life is challenge and growth. And if there's one
thing I've learned from having the guts to move across the country, it's that growth happens outside of your comfort zone. I've danced
a little bit of hip hop, but there's something about it that often evades me. The sharpness, insanely intense control and precision. Dance
is all about how you move, not the moves you make. I move slowly, don't know why, that's just my body's default setting. And now it's time
to challenge that, get a little uncomfortable, grow some.</br>
2. It's hip hop. Who doesn't want to learn how to move like the dancers in the video?

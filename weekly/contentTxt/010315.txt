1. Had a goodbye/see you later dinner/adventure with friends. <3 </br>
2. Practiced lots and lots of Ruby!</br>
3. Got my new laptop in the mail, set it up, and pretty much fell in love with it (although Windows 8 will take some getting used to, apps on my laptop? weird.)</br>
4. Spent my New Year's Eve subduing creeping feelings of anxiety by packing with my mom. </br>
5. Didn't cry at the airport. </br>
6. Moved nearly 3,000 miles away from home.

1. Got accepted into <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus!</a> A four month class + 1 month internship on programming. In Portland, OR. </br>
2. Booked a flight using mileage that would expire at the end of the year. Lucky right?</br>
3. Freaked out / was in denial that I'd be moving outta my parents' house and across the country in three- count 'em 1,2,3- weeks. </br>
4. Randomly decided it was time to hike <a href="http://www.hikingupward.com/SNP/OldRag/" target="_blank">Old Rag</a>. And by hike I mean walk very slowly up a mountain with my boyfriend. At 8am, with the temperature in the low thirties. Pros: no one else out there. Cons: if you stopped hiking, you'd freeze.</br>
5a. Got tricked by my eyes into thinking a log, a shadow in a little rock cave, and another log / tree stump were bears. </br>
5b. Scrambled up my first ever rock scramble and loved it. I think I like climbing around on rocks for a few minutes much more than walking for hours.</br>
6. Didn't realize where exactly the summit was, so fell in love with the first two overlooks we came across. Also saw lots of curious rock formations. Seriously, who makes giant rock snowmen? </br>
7. Had an idea to make this blog. Weekly recaps have become habitual thanks to an internship, and drawing + list making = easy enough to do. I have no idea how I'll make this thing work, but I'll try to figure out something either with PHP or... just taking the extra time to upload files and update links. Yep, I've still got lots to learn. Good thing I'm Epicodus bound.

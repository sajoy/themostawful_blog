2. Had lunch with a friend I've had since elementary school and spent an hour talking about the future and our potential and 
how becoming adults is just so nuts.</br>
3. Made a pretty nifty Secret Santa present: a Justice League calendar using a minimalist poster from Wal*Mart.</br>
4. Also made a super nifty snowman cheese ball with a bacon scarf, cranberry eyes, cherry stem arms and mouth, and a strawberry hat
for the Secret Santa exchange party.</br>
5. Visited my happy place- a Goodwill Outlet where items are priced by the pound / really cheap. $2.75 for a pair of slightly worn boots?
Yes, please. </br>
6. Ordered a new laptop, because when your parents offer to buy you a new laptop on top of helping you out with a major move, you say
"Thank you." </br>
7. Felt hopeful.

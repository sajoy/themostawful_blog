1. Sumo wrestled (in an oversized cushiony sumo suit). Won my first round, lost my second, but did manage to do a pretty slick knee bounce recovery.</br>
2. Reviewed the HTML and CSS sections for Epicodus, started learning how to use the console, and a little bit o' Ruby.</br>
3. Wrapped Christmas presents last minute (as always) with re-used wrapping paper and bags (because that's what my family does). </br>
4. Celebrated Christmas with family and friends and lots of food. </br>
5. Packed, aka started piling things to bring near my suitcase.</br>
6. Visited the Gaylord at the National Harbor, walked through ICE!, and ran to <a href="http://www.thecapitalwheel.com/" target="_blank">the Capital Wheel</a> to catch the very last ride in the fog. </br>
7. Received an Intuos Wacom tablet from my brother! Hence, the digital drawing this week.</br>
8. Started saying good-byes/see you laters...

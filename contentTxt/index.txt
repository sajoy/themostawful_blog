Nobody else can be alive for you; <br>
nor can you be alive for anybody else.<br>
Toms can be Dicks and Dicks can be Harrys, <br>
but none of them can ever be you.<br>
There's the artist's responsibility; <br>
and <a href="#">the most awful responsibility</a> on earth. <br>
If you can take it, take it-and be. <br>
If you can't, cheer up, <br>
and go about other people's business; <br>
and do (or undo) till you drop.<br><br>
